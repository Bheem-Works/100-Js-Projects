# 📝 To-Do List App

Hey everyone!  
This is a **basic To-Do List app** I built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It's my first time making something like this all by myself, and yeah… I’ve made quite a few mistakes 😅 — but that’s part of the learning process, right?

## 🎥 Why I Made This

I was recording a video while building this app so I could upload it to YouTube.  
The goal wasn’t perfection — it was just to **share my learning experience** with you all.  
Even if I messed up here and there, I hope it still helps someone out there.

### ❗ Note:
I know the code has some bugs and silly mistakes.  
But maybe seeing them helps you **learn what to avoid** too. So take it easy, laugh at the fails, and learn from them 💡

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **HTML** (structure)
- **CSS** (basic styling, already written before starting JS)
- **JavaScript** (functionality)

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Add new tasks  
- 🗑️ Delete tasks  
- 💾 Save tasks using **Local Storage** (so your list stays after refreshing)  
- 🔄 More features coming soon...

## 📌 Future Plans

I'm planning to keep updating this app with more cool features — and every time I do, I’ll upload a new video on the **same YouTube link**.  
So stay tuned if you're into real beginner coding journeys!

## ❤️ Final Words

Thanks for checking this out!  
I know it's not perfect, but I’m proud of doing it **on my own for the first time**.  
Hope you find it helpful, or at least fun to watch!

Peace ✌️
